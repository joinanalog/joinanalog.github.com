	<h1>Welcome to Analog.is, we love paper.</h1>
	<p>Last December we created a limited edition run of 1,000 beautifully letter-pressed red-on-red notebooks. We chose the infamous Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano as the theme.</p>
	<p>There are some notebooks still left. So many people thought they were amazing and wanted a copy, we decided to out the few remaining up for sale. Order a notebook for $11 (shipping included) or a pack of 3 for $25 (shipping included).</p>
	<p><cite><a href="http://aitor.is/writing-on/the-shape-of-your-notes/">The shape of your notes</a></cite> is all about the process of going from idea to an actual notebook</p>
